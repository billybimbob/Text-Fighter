List of Things I Need to Change
Start working on abilities that have each unique scaling calculators on damage. Make it so monster can use abilities but its rng.
	Add magic attacks
	Add description of abilities
Mana regen? and cost
Make monster variables private
Rogue class?
	fast, weak, stealth
	instakill, maybe an ultimate?
Shifter class
	add to interface
	test out
Bug: monster target changing somehow, only seen affecting bandit, when in middle of attacks
Bug: changing form to pangolin as eagle changes to eagle
Add passives - in status of monsters
an inventory item that can be used as a 1 turn consumable to deal damage. example: select a rock on the inventory to deal 8 dmg on one monster once
Flesh out potion effects
Maybe: add title to choice options?
Make monsters have better ai
Round damage to 2 decimal places


Talk with Marcel
calculations

Ish - might want to revist
Spin attack: doesn't account for when an enemy dies
Regenerate mana somehow?
	Ability or over time
Add stun mechanic- reset stuns at the end of the turn
Account for max inventory??
Hp cost abilities- recoil
	priority attack
Reflect
Bug: monster seems to reset attack move possibly after another monster's turn is skipped from being stunned

Done
Assess the UI. Right now the ui is built so that the hero always goes first. Make it so that you input your actions then all the fighting sequences happen in the correct order
Bug: Used crit potions, then crit potion after gave 0 crit, check this for all potions
Buffs override other buffs instead of waiting for the duration of one buff to expire
Add "back" option in choices
figure out how to have an attack be multiple turns
