List of Things I need to change
Start working on abilities that have each unique scaling calculators on damage. Make it so monster can use abilities but its rng.
	figure out how to have an attack be multiple turns
	Add magic attacks
	Add description of abilities
an inventory item that can be used as a 1 turn consumable to deal damage. example: select a rock on the inventory to deal 8 dmg on one monster once
Account for max inventory??
Add stun mechanic- reset stuns at the end of the turn
Spin attack: doesn't account for when an enemy dies
Flesh out potion effects
Bug: monster seems to reset attack move possibly after another monster's turn is skipped from being stunned
Maybe: add title to choice options?
Make monsters have better ai
Round damage to 2 decimal places
Regenerate mana somehow?
	Ability or over time

Talk with Marcel
calculations

Done
Assess the UI. Right now the ui is built so that the hero always goes first. Make it so that you input your actions then all the fighting sequences happen in the correct order
Bug: Used crit potions, then crit potion after gave 0 crit, check this for all potions
Buffs override other buffs instead of waiting for the duration of one buff to expire
Add "back" option in choices
